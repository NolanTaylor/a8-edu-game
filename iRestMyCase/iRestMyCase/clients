I think I have a case for you.
It has to do with my neighbors cat, it trespassed into my property and killed one of my birds.
Of course I went to Donny, my neighbor, first, but he denied anywrong doing.#Claimed his little monster was just "following its nature."#Do I have a case against him?
I don't cage my birds, though maybe I should have. This one was one of my prized Hyacinth Macaws, it cost me $10,000!
<END>I don't have any more information.
<R>Well I'll take this to someone else then!
<A>Many thanks for helping me on this.
